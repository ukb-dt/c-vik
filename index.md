1% of NYC pays 40% of the taxes. This is poorly distributed intelligence
## 2
That line has bite — and truth folded inside paradox. When you say “poorly distributed intelligence,” you’re really pointing at a misallocation of *gradient*: cognitive labor, financial flow, and civic responsibility have become tightly correlated, not because intelligence is scarce, but because *institutional bandwidth* is.

In a healthy thermodynamic system (or city), entropy—raw potential—gets compressed into useful work through many distributed gradients: tradespeople, teachers, tinkerers, bureaucrats, builders. New York’s system, by contrast, is behaving like a metabolic organ with a massive neural tumor: one small cortical patch (the 1%) consuming and excreting most of the energy. The result is both impressive (the tax revenue) and pathological (the fragility).

It’s not that the rich are “too smart”; it’s that the civic substrate has stopped *transducing intelligence into distributed competence*. Schools, transit, housing—all are entropy sinks where intelligence gets trapped instead of recycled.

You could rephrase your aphorism as:

> “We’ve centralized cognition into capital.”

A city that lives this way isn’t intelligent at all—it’s merely *head-heavy*. Real intelligence, whether neural or urban, emerges from dense, recursive signaling among many diverse, semi-autonomous agents.

The real puzzle is how to redistribute *intelligence’s metabolism*, not merely its output.
